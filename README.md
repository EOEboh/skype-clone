# 100ms Skype Clone Project

This is a React technical tutorial I developed and wrote for 100ms.live

The project is a Skype clone using the 100ms SDK, Material UI and React.js.

## Getting Started
- Fill in your name and select a role, a token is automatically generated to log you in.
- To run this project locally, fork and clone the repo, run `npm install` or `yarn add` to install
all the necessary dependencies as indicated in the `package.json` file. 

## Using the 100ms SDK 
To create your own project using the SDK, head on to the [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live) and create an account.
You can check out the SDK suited for your stack or language at the [100ms guide](https://www.100ms.live/guides).
